## Installing Claude Code Extension

I'll help you install a Claude Code extension using PACC.

### 🔍 Analyzing installation request: $ARGUMENTS

First, let me check what we're installing:

!`cd /Users/m/ai-workspace/pacc/pacc-dev/apps/pacc-cli && python -m pacc install $ARGUMENTS --json 2>&1`

Based on the installation results, I'll provide you with:
- ✅ What was successfully installed
- 📁 Where it was installed (user or project level)
- 🔧 Any configuration that was updated
- ⚠️  Any warnings or issues encountered

The extension is now ready to use in Claude Code!
