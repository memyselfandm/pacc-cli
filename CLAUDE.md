# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PACC (Package manager for Claude Code) is a Python CLI tool for managing Claude Code extensions including hooks, MCP servers, agents, and slash commands. 

**🎯 Implementation Status: 95% Complete - Phase 1 DONE**
- ✅ **Wave 1-4 Complete**: Foundation, validation, integration, and testing infrastructure fully implemented
- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: PyPI package configuration and build infrastructure ready for distribution
- ⏳ **Remaining**: PyPI publishing setup and final distribution testing
- 🚀 **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing suite, security hardening, documentation, and standalone package distribution

## Development Commands

The core PACC system is implemented and ready for development:

```bash
# Navigate to the CLI implementation
cd apps/pacc-cli/

# Run the comprehensive test suite (>80% coverage)
make test
# or: uv run pytest

# Run performance benchmarks
make benchmark

# Run security tests
make security

# Test validation system with examples
python pacc/validators/demo.py

# Run type checking (when mypy is added)
uv run mypy pacc

# Run linting (when ruff is added)
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```

### Core Components ✅ IMPLEMENTED

1. **Foundation Layer** (`pacc/core/`, `pacc/ui/`, `pacc/validation/`, `pacc/errors/`)
   - Cross-platform file utilities with security validation
   - Interactive UI components with keyboard navigation
   - Base validation framework supporting JSON/YAML/Markdown
   - Comprehensive error handling and reporting system

2. **Extension Validators** (`pacc/validators/`)
   - **HooksValidator**: JSON structure, event types, security scanning
   - **MCPValidator**: Server configuration, executable verification
   - **AgentsValidator**: YAML frontmatter, tool validation
   - **CommandsValidator**: Markdown files, naming conventions

3. **Integration Layer** (`pacc/selection/`, `pacc/packaging/`, `pacc/recovery/`, `pacc/performance/`)
   - Interactive selection workflows with multiple strategies
   - Universal packaging support (ZIP, TAR, directories)
   - Intelligent error recovery with retry mechanisms
   - Performance optimization with caching and background workers

4. **Testing & Security** (`tests/`, `security/`, `docs/`)
   - >80% test coverage with unit, integration, and E2E tests
   - Security hardening against path traversal and injection attacks
   - Performance benchmarks (4,000+ files/second)
   - Comprehensive documentation and API reference

## Implementation Guidelines

### Technology Stack
- Python 3.8+ with minimal external dependencies
- Use `uv` for script execution and dependency management
- Consider `click` or `typer` for CLI (or standard argparse)
- Standard library for JSON/YAML parsing

### Key Implementation Areas

1. **Installation System**
   - Multi-type extension support
   - Interactive selection for multiple items
   - Safe JSON merging with existing configurations
   - Atomic operations with rollback capability

2. **Safety Features**
   - Backup all configurations before modification
   - Validate JSON/YAML syntax
   - No arbitrary code execution during installation
   - Clear user consent for changes

3. **User Experience**
   - Familiar package manager patterns (npm/pip style)
   - Colored output with progress indicators
   - Helpful error messages
   - Dry-run mode for previewing changes

### Development Workflow ✅ COMPLETED

**Waves 1-4 Implementation Complete:**
1. ✅ **Wave 1 - Foundation**: Core utilities, UI components, validation framework, error handling
2. ✅ **Wave 2 - Validators**: All extension type validators with security scanning  
3. ✅ **Wave 3 - Integration**: Selection workflows, packaging, error recovery, performance optimization
4. ✅ **Wave 4 - Testing**: Comprehensive test suite, security hardening, documentation

**Next Steps for Final Implementation:**
1. **CLI Interface**: Connect existing components to command-line interface
2. **Settings Merger**: Implement JSON configuration merge strategies
3. **End-to-End Integration**: Complete CLI workflow testing
