# PACC - Package Manager for Claude Code
## Product Requirements Document

### 1. Executive Summary

**Product Name**: PACC (Package manager for Claude Code)  
**Version**: 1.0 MVP  
**Target Users**: Claude Code developers and teams  
**Purpose**: Simplify installation, management, and sharing of Claude Code extensions (hooks, MCP servers, agents, and slash commands)

PACC addresses the current friction in setting up and sharing Claude Code extensions by providing a familiar package manager experience similar to npm, pip, or brew. It automates the safe installation and configuration of Claude Code components while maintaining proper project isolation and team collaboration workflows.

### 2. Problem Statement

Currently, setting up Claude Code extensions requires:
- Manual file creation and placement in specific directories
- Manual editing of settings.json files
- Understanding of complex file structure and naming conventions
- Prone to configuration errors and security risks
- Difficult to share configurations across teams
- No standardized way to distribute and discover extensions

### 3. Product Goals

**Primary Goals:**
- Reduce Claude Code extension setup time from minutes to seconds
- Eliminate configuration errors through automation
- Enable easy sharing of extensions across teams and projects
- Provide a secure, validated installation process
- Create a standardized distribution format for Claude Code extensions

**Success Metrics:**
- 90% reduction in time to install and configure Claude Code extensions
- Zero manual settings.json editing required for standard installations
- 100% of installations maintain proper security boundaries
- Adoption by 50%+ of active Claude Code users within 6 months

### 4. User Stories

**As a developer, I want to:**
- Install a shared team hook with one command so I don't have to manually configure it
- Browse and select from multiple hooks in a repository without installing everything
- Initialize a new project with standard team configurations automatically
- Install extensions at user-level to use across all my projects
- Remove extensions cleanly without breaking my configuration

**As a team lead, I want to:**
- Define a standard set of extensions for my team in a configuration file
- Share extension configurations through version control
- Ensure team members use consistent tooling and hooks
- Control which extensions can be installed from external sources

**As an extension author, I want to:**
- Package my hook/agent/command for easy distribution
- Document installation requirements and usage clearly
- Provide multiple installation options (project vs user level)
- Version my extensions and provide upgrade paths
