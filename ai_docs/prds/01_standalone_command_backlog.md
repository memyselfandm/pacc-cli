# PACC Standalone Command Distribution Backlog

## Overview

This backlog covers the implementation of standalone command distribution for PACC, enabling users to install and use `pacc` as a system-wide command via `pip install pacc` or `uv tool install pacc`. This transforms PACC from a project-local tool into a globally available package manager following standard Python packaging practices.

**Current Status**: Planning Phase  
**Core Functionality**: ✅ CLI Implementation Complete  
**Package Structure**: ✅ Python Package Ready  
**Missing Components**: Package Configuration, PyPI Distribution Setup

### F2.2: Package Name Registration and Branding
**Feature**: Secure package name and establish distribution identity
**Priority**: Medium - Important for user discovery and trust

- [ ] Research package name availability
  - Check `pacc` availability on PyPI
  - Research alternative names if needed
  - Validate name consistency across platforms
- [ ] Register package name
  - Reserve package name on PyPI
  - Create placeholder package if necessary
  - Document name registration and ownership
- [ ] Establish package branding

  - Design package documentation and README
  - Establish project homepage and documentation site
- [ ] Configure package discovery
  - Optimize PyPI classifiers for discoverability
  - Add appropriate keywords and tags
  - Configure project links and references
- [ ] Test package discoverability
  - Verify package appears in PyPI search
  - Test installation via various package managers
  - Validate package metadata display

## Phase 3: Documentation and User Experience

### F3.1: Installation Documentation and Guides
**Feature**: Comprehensive documentation for standalone installation and usage
**Priority**: Medium - Essential for user adoption

- [ ] Create installation documentation
  - Document pip install pacc workflow
  - Add uv tool install pacc instructions
  - Include pipx installation option
  - Cover virtual environment best practices
- [ ] Add usage documentation

## Dependency Analysis

### Prerequisites
- ✅ **CLI Implementation**: Complete and functional
- ✅ **Package Structure**: Python package structure ready
- ✅ **Core Functionality**: All PACC features implemented and tested

### Critical Path
1. **F1.1** → **F1.2**: Package config must be complete before build testing
2. **F1.2** → **F2.1**: Local testing must pass before PyPI publishing
3. **F2.1** → **F2.2**: Publishing setup required before name registration
4. **F2.1** → **F3.1**: Package must be published before documentation finalization

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- **F3.1** and **F3.2** can be developed in parallel with publishing setup
- **F2.2** can be started during **F1.2** implementation
- Documentation can be drafted during package configuration
