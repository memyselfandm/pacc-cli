# PACC Standalone Command Distribution Backlog

## Overview

This backlog covers the implementation of standalone command distribution for PACC, enabling users to install and use `pacc` as a system-wide command via `pip install pacc` or `uv tool install pacc`. This transforms PACC from a project-local tool into a globally available package manager following standard Python packaging practices.

**Current Status**: Phase 2 Complete - Ready for PyPI Publication  
**Core Functionality**: ✅ CLI Implementation Complete  
**Package Structure**: ✅ Python Package Ready  
**Package Configuration**: ✅ Complete with pyproject.toml  
**Build Infrastructure**: ✅ Complete with automation and testing  
**Publishing Infrastructure**: ✅ Complete with documentation and scripts  
**Documentation & QA**: ✅ Complete with comprehensive guides and testing  
**Next Step**: Update package name to 'pacc-cli' and publish to PyPI

## Dependency Analysis

### Prerequisites
- ✅ **CLI Implementation**: Complete and functional
- ✅ **Package Structure**: Python package structure ready
- ✅ **Core Functionality**: All PACC features implemented and tested

### Critical Path
1. **F1.1** → **F1.2**: Package config must be complete before build testing
2. **F1.2** → **F2.1**: Local testing must pass before PyPI publishing
3. **F2.1** → **F2.2**: Publishing setup required before name registration
4. **F2.1** → **F3.1**: Package must be published before documentation finalization

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- **F3.1** and **F3.2** can be developed in parallel with publishing setup
- **F2.2** can be started during **F1.2** implementation
- Documentation can be drafted during package configuration
