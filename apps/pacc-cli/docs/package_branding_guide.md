# PACC Package Branding Guide

## Executive Summary

PACC (Package manager for Claude Code) requires a strong brand identity to establish itself as the official package manager for Claude Code extensions. Given that the name "pacc" is already taken on PyPI, this guide provides alternative naming strategies and comprehensive branding guidelines.

## Package Naming Strategy

### Primary Recommendation: `pacc-cli`

Based on availability checking, **`pacc-cli`** is available on PyPI and offers several advantages:

1. **Clear Association**: Maintains the PACC brand while indicating CLI nature
2. **Available**: Confirmed available on both PyPI and TestPyPI
3. **Discoverable**: Users searching for "pacc" will find it
4. **Professional**: Follows common naming patterns (like `aws-cli`, `azure-cli`)

### Alternative Names (All Available)

| Name | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| `pypacc` | Python prefix convention | Less distinctive |
| `claude-pacc` | Clear Claude association | Longer to type |
| `pacc-manager` | Descriptive | Redundant (pacc = package manager) |
| `pacc-ext` | Short, indicates extensions | Less clear purpose |

### Final Recommendation

**Use `pacc-cli` for PyPI registration** while maintaining "PACC" as the brand name in documentation and marketing materials.
