# Package Naming Considerations

## Current Status

The package name "pacc" is **already taken** on PyPI:
- **Existing Package**: https://pypi.org/project/pacc/
- **Version**: 0.0.606
- **Author**: Coco
- **Description**: Appears to be a different project

## Alternative Naming Strategies

Since "pacc" is unavailable, consider these alternatives:

### 1. Namespace Prefix
Add an organizational prefix:
- `anthropic-pacc`
- `claude-pacc`
- `cc-pacc` (Claude Code PACC)

### 2. Descriptive Names
Be more explicit about the purpose:
- `claude-code-package-manager`
- `claude-extensions-manager`
- `claude-code-pacc`

### 3. Creative Variations
Maintain the PACC acronym with variations:
- `pypacc` (Python PACC)
- `pacc-cli` (PACC Command Line Interface)
- `pacc-manager`
- `pacc-tool`

### 4. Acronym Expansion
Use the full acronym:
- `package-manager-claude-code`
- `pmcc` (Package Manager Claude Code)

## Recommended Approach

1. **Check Availability First**
   ```bash
   python scripts/package_registration/check_pypi_availability.py <new-name>
   ```

2. **Consider Trademark and Branding**
   - Ensure the name doesn't conflict with existing trademarks
   - Check domain availability if planning a website
   - Consider how the name looks in imports: `import pacc` vs `import claude_pacc`

3. **Update Package Configuration**
   When you decide on a new name, update:
   - `pyproject.toml`: Change the `name` field
   - `README.md`: Update all references
   - Documentation: Global find/replace
   - GitHub repository name (if changing)

## Test PyPI Strategy

While "pacc" is taken on production PyPI, it's available on Test PyPI. This means:
- You can still test the full publishing workflow using Test PyPI
- The production name needs to be decided before the first real release
- Consider reserving your chosen name on PyPI early

## Name Reservation Process

Once you decide on a name:

1. **Reserve on PyPI**
   - Create a minimal package
   - Upload version 0.0.1 as a placeholder
   - Add description: "Name reserved for [project description]"

2. **Update Documentation**
   - This prevents others from taking the name
   - Gives you time to prepare the full release

## Configuration Updates Required

When changing the package name, update these locations:

1. **pyproject.toml**
   ```toml
   [project]
   name = "new-package-name"
   ```

2. **Installation Instructions**
   ```bash
   pip install new-package-name
   ```

3. **Import Statements** (if changing)
   ```python
   import pacc  # or new module name
   ```

4. **CLI Commands** (typically unchanged)
   ```bash
   pacc install ...  # Usually keep the same command name
   ```

## Decision Checklist

Before finalizing a new name:

- [ ] Name is available on PyPI
- [ ] Name is available on Test PyPI  
- [ ] No trademark conflicts
- [ ] Easy to type and remember
- [ ] Clear relationship to purpose
- [ ] No offensive meanings in other languages
- [ ] Domain available (if needed)
- [ ] GitHub organization allows the name
- [ ] Team consensus achieved

## Next Steps

1. Run availability checker on proposed names
2. Discuss with team/stakeholders
3. Update configuration files
4. Reserve name on PyPI
5. Update all documentation
6. Proceed with publishing workflow
